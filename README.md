# Unfuddle Ticket to GitHub issue copier
Copies Unfuddle ticket data into new GitHub issues. Ensures that the Unfuddle ticket numbers match the new GitHub issues created.

## Why
One of the software projects that I started and maintained for several years now had been using Unfuddle (https://unfuddle.com/) for ticket management and Git repository.
Recently, there's been a need to move this project into GitHub so that it's placed together with the other projects that I'm working on and not having to use two separate services.
Simply moving the repository into GitHub and start using it for new issues won't work because GitHub starts with issue #1 and the project's codebase has references to the Unfuddle ticket numbers.
